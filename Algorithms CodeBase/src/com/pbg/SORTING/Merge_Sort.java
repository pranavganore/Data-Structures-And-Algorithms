/**
 *	* Note 1 : Merge Sort is not an 'in place' sorting algorithm.
 * 
 * ->	An algorithm is said to be in place, if it does not require extra memory,
 * 			except a constant amount of memory units. (i.e. it should not require 
 * 			any extra allocation space that is proportional to the input size or 
 * 			even a function of the input size. But the constant amount of extra space,
 * 			like few extra variables are ok.)
 * 		And since merge sort requires extra memory in the form of auxiliary array
 * 			to hold the merge, it is not an in place algorithm.

/**
 *	* Note 2 :	Hybrid Algorithm : Tim Sort (by - Tim Peters)
 * 
 * 		Combines merge sort and insertion sort for worst case ùöØ( n log n ) time
 * 			and best case ùöØ( n ) time.
 * 
 * 		Tim Sort has been Python's standard sorting algorithm since V 2.3
 * 		And java also uses this algorithm to sort its objects.
